  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Boiled eggs...the most basic of dishes, asides from cracking open those ramen
    noodles you have in the cupboard. Nothing like the taste of college.
    Fun fact, hens regularly give eggs that are sterile, which both the farmer and hens
    know will not yield an offspring. The farmers take these from the coop and they eventually
    end up in your pot.</p>
